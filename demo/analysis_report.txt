# ARM Performance Analysis Report

**CPU:** Neoverse-N1 (4-wide decode, 8-wide issue)
**Cycles:** 11,352,894,470
**Instructions:** 22,192,837,981
**IPC:** 1.95 (theoretical max: 4.0)

## IPC Efficiency
Achieved 48.8% of theoretical maximum IPC.

## Pipeline Stalls
- Frontend (fetch/decode): 7.7% idle
- Backend (execute/retire): 26.1% idle

## Cache Hierarchy
- L1I miss rate: 0.00% (6,168,803 / 0)
- L1D miss rate: 0.72% (39,335,815 / 5,473,271,714)
- LLC miss rate: 0.70% (38,518,125 / 5,474,666,458)

## Branch Prediction
- Branch miss rate: 1.29% (61,244,058 / 4,737,968,477)
- Each mispredict costs ~13 cycles
- Estimated cycle waste: 796,172,754 cycles (7.0% of total)

## TLB
- iTLB miss rate: 0.000%
- dTLB miss rate: 0.000%

## Neoverse-N1 Optimization Opportunities

**Macro-op fusion:** N1 fuses compare+branch pairs into single ops.
Ensure hot loops use: CMP/CMN/TST/ADDS/SUBS immediately followed by B.cond

**Decode width:** N1 decodes 4 instructions/cycle.
Keep critical loop bodies to multiples of 4 instructions for optimal decode throughput.

**ROB depth:** 128 entries. Long dependency chains starve the backend.
Break dependency chains by using independent accumulators (e.g., sum0 + sum1 instead of single sum).

## Issues Summary

🟠 **[IPC]** IPC 1.95 is below 50% efficiency
🟡 **[Backend]** 26.1% backend stalls — some execution bottleneck
